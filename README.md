# Rabin-Karp-Algorith
Robin Karp Algorithm using python (language)
# OVER VIEW
•	Richard M. Karp and Michael O. Rabin created the Robin Karp algorithm in 1987.
•	Robin Karp algorithm is a string searching or pattern finding algorithm.
•	Robin Karp Algorithm is used to reduce the time complexity of matching strings.
•	It uses the concept of Hashing.
•	The important function in the algorithm is the hash function


# USES
•	Plagiarism detection
•	Email detection
•	Pattern matching

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion Rabin karp algorithm is used to find any pattern in the given sentence. 
This is done by using the hash value which is the efficient way of finding any pattern in the given string
